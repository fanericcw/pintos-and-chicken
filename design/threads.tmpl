                 ALARM CLOCK
                 ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

struct thread {
    /* No changes to exisiting members of the struct */

    /* New attribute for Project 1 Alarm Clock implementation */
    int64_t wakeup_tick;              
}

int64_t wakeup_tick - Once this variable hits 0, the with this tick will
be removed from the wake_list and go to the ready_list.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.
Timer_sleep calls another function in thread.c called thread_sleep.
This function in thread.c inserts the current thread into a list
struct called "wake_list". Before it inserts into the list, the 
function blocks interrupts to handle multiple thread synchronization.
After inserting, we change the "wake_tick" of that thread to be the
amount of ticks it takes to wake it back up. Finally we block the thread
and re-enable interrupts.

In the timer interrupt handler, we call to the function thread_check_wake
in thread.c. What thread_check_wake does is, it starts at the beginning 
of the list, and loops through all elements. When it finds an element
to wake up, similarly to thread_sleep, it will disable interrupts, remove
the element from the wake_list and then set the wake_tick to 0 before
re-enabling interrupts.

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?
To minimize the amount of time spent in timer interrupt, sort
the wake_list by wakeup_tick. When checking which threads to wake up,
We only need to loop until we find a thread's "wakeup_tick" is above
the global_tick or when the wake_list is empty. This ensures that we
are not checking the other threads unnecessarily. 

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?
Disabling interrupts helps synchronize multiple threads.

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?
To avoid race conditions when a timer interrupt occurs during a call to 
timer sleep(), our algorithm temporarily disable interrupts.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?
This design was chosen since it is easy to keep track of all the threads
in the wake_list since pintos has provided the list implemntation already.
It is also easy to understand how the algorithm works, when we sleep the
thread, we remove it from the ready_list and put it on the wake_list and
when we are ready to wake it up we remove it from the sleep_list and
put it back on the ready_list. Previous design ideas did not have any
list sorting which meant we had to check every thread in the wake_list.
The current design involves sorting the item as the element enters the list.
This design is superior since it allows us to check threads that do not
need to wake up at most once.

               SURVEY QUESTIONS
               ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
